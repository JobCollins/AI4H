# AI for HealthCare
This is a repository for Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare

Here I build, evaluate, and integrate predictive models that have the power to transform patient outcomes. 
I begin by classifying and segmenting 2D and 3D medical images to augment diagnosis and then 
Move on to modeling patient outcomes with electronic health records to optimize clinical trial testing decisions. 
Finally, I build an algorithm that uses data collected from wearable devices to estimate the wearerâ€™s pulse rate in the presence of motion.
